   <h3>Shaded outdoor play areas</h3>
    <p>
        Playground shade sails are a beautiful option for shading playgrounds and allow for creativity and customization when designing your shade structure. They can be configured into overlapping triangular sails for greater depth to the design or can be laid out in swooping hyperbolic square canopies.

    <h3>Makers room for design thinking and project based - learning</h3>
    <p>
        The ideas of what students will produce in PBL are often set by the teacher. In Design Thinking students make the choice about what their prototype will be. Prototype or product ideas for learning are often set in advance in a PBL project (“you will produce a film”, or “you will be able to use multimedia and text”)
